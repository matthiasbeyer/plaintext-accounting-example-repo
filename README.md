# Plaintext-Accounting example repo

Example repository for my "Plaintext Accounting" talk at UnFUCK 2024.

This repository is made with
[beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount).

There's no real data here, only playaround data.

# Usage

Either install
[beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount)
from your distros package manager or use the power of nix:

```
$ nix develop
```

to get started.

You can also `nix flake check` to verify everything is in order with the
transactions and postings in the example data.
